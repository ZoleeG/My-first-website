            <p>Speedrunning is the act of playing
                a video game, or section of a video game,
                with the goal of completing it as fast as possible.
                Speedrunning often involves following planned routes,
                which may incorporate sequence breaking and can exploit glitches
                that allow sections to be skipped or completed more quickly than
                intended. Tool-assisted speedrunning (TAS) is a subcategory of
                speedrunning that uses emulation software to slow the game down
                and create a precisely controlled sequence of inputs.

                <p>HyperText Markup Language, or HTML,
                is the standard markup language for creating
                Web pages. A markup language uses tags to identify
                structure and elements within a document.
                Each element in an HTML document tells the browser
                how to display the contents of that document.
                There is an almost endless amount of tags available
                for various different purposes in HTML, far too many to
                memorise and so documentation will be your best friend.
                Here are a couple of examples to bookmark:
